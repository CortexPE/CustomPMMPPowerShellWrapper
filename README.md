# CustomPMMPPowerShellWrapper

What it does:
 - s.bat - starts s.ps1 (when I'm too lazy lol)
 - s.ps1 - the guy who updates it, extracts phar -> src folder (for PHPStorm indexing), then starts the server up
 
 Like I said, I use this personally for development. I only released it here because someone asked me to. lol
